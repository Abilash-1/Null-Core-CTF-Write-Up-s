1. **Trifecta‚Äôs Trail**

**Difficulty:** Easy/ 100 points

**Description:**  
hey guys check out this cool website i just found the author must be quite the writer he explained vulnerabilities like a true gentlement iykyk buttt i think they might be something fishy going on they check it out\!\!\! here ya go user : [https://balakumaran1507.github.io/Trifecta\_CTF/](https://balakumaran1507.github.io/Trifecta_CTF/)

**Solution:**  
The challenge name ‚ÄúTrifecta‚Äù was basically screaming *three stages, bro*. So I popped open the page source and, yep, there were three sneaky Base64 strings chilling in different corners of the files.

* **Layer 1** ‚Äì Hiding in the CSS like it owned the place, tucked inside a `content:` property.

* **Layer 2** ‚Äì Sitting in the HTML under the XSS section, trying to act like a command line snippet. Nice try.

* **Layer 3** ‚Äì Just vibing in the linked JavaScript file.

Decoded each of them one by one, slapped the pieces together like digital LEGO, and boom the full flag popped out.

Flag: **NOCT{im\_just\_wasting\_ur\_time}**

ayoooo its me again ofc im again with a super cool website well sooner or later this author gonna blow up like litterally.... may god bless his soul here ya go bud : [https://balakumaran1507.github.io/fck\_bots\_CTF/](https://balakumaran1507.github.io/fck_bots_CTF/)

**Solution:**

First stop ‚Äî robots.txt. Always worth a peek to see what the site doesn‚Äôt want you snooping around in. Sure enough, it had a `/unlisted/` path sitting there like a neon ‚Äúcome check me out‚Äù sign.

![unlisted](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cc34185f-c1df-4503-96ca-71d3934cafcb)

Rolled over to that directory, and there it was `flag.txt` just chilling. Opened it up, and boom‚Ä¶ flag secured.

**Solution:**

Checked the page source and spotted a `console.log` near the bottom that screamed ‚Äúlook at the JS file.‚Äù

Popped open the JS in the site‚Äôs resources and saw a `parts` array loaded with Base64 chunks. Decoded them, stitched them together, and boom  full flag unlocked.

4. **One Last Time ü•Ç**

**Difficulty:** Easy/ 200 points

**Description:** 

hear me out okay?\! i just have one last super dexule cool website to show you just one more and i promise this is the last of the great authors website well its pretty sad our journey ends here but it was a good one player here ya go ur last target take him down: [https://balakumaran1507.github.io/LSB\_shapes\_CTF/](https://balakumaran1507.github.io/LSB_shapes_CTF/) all he wanted was to make websites for her and u distoryed every single on of em.... i hope u feel good with those points...

**Solution:**

Hit the GitHub Pages URL, poked around the source and assets, and spotted a weirdly named `smaple.svg` (yep, typo).

![sample](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/05d82314-7c3a-440e-b780-01ffdb51deaf)

Cracked it open and found a `<metadata>` tag holding an `EncodedFlag` value, while the `<desc>` was just there to throw me off.

![meta](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b2dec508-fa3a-4fa0-8de0-b16ce206e042)

Grabbed the Base64 string from the metadata, decoded it, and boom flag in hand.

Flag: **NOCT{svg\_svg\_svg}**
