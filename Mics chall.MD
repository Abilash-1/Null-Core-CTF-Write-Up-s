### **3\. Meta Mama**

Difficulty: Easy/ 100 points

**Description:**  
Ethey... Insta la bot ah? üëÄ There‚Äôs something strange about the Instagram account: @neuxdemorphous At first glance, it looks like a normal page ‚Äî but beneath the surface, there‚Äôs something hidden.

**Solution:**  
*While exploring the challenge, I came across an unusual hint referring to the Instagram account **@neuxdemorphous**. At first glance, it appeared like a regular profile, but the bio **‚Äúlove is god‚Äù** felt oddly cryptic ‚Äî possibly a clue.*  
*Out of curiosity, I sent a direct message to the account. To my surprise, it replied instantly, hinting at some kind of automated bot behind the scenes.*  
*The response included the phrase **‚Äúterrifying NOCTORIAN DRAGON‚Äù**, which seemed intentionally emphasized ‚Äî possibly the next clue or part of the flag.*

Flag: **NOCT{NOCTORIAN\_DRAGON}**

### **4\. The Mighty Paul**

Difficulty: Easy/ 100 points

**Description:**  
Forget payloads. Forget Wireshark. This time, the only thing standing between you and the flag... is pure testosterone.  
Straight from the mystical lands of China, The Mighty Paul has trained for this moment his whole life. While others brute-force passwords, Paul brute-forces people.  
He doesn‚Äôt speak much. He doesn‚Äôt need to. His forearm does the talking ‚Äî and occasionally the crushing.  
‚öî **Challenge:** Face Paul in a real-life arm wrestling duel. Win, and something very interesting might come your way.  
How to Play:  
Walk up to the arena.  
Sit. Lock hands. Try not to scream.  
Wrestle. Win. Profit.  
Don‚Äôt ask where the flag is. Just believe.  
Remember he doesn't talk.

**Solution:**  
Defeat the Chinese challenger in an arm-wrestling match. Face him, win the duel, and obtain the flag from his hand.

**Solution:**  
The challenge provided a YouTube video with the description: ‚ÄúBEWARE FOR FAKE FLAGS\! All the best for finding it, hope you guys make it till the end. üôè While watching, I spotted a flag within the first five minutes and tried submitting it but it turned out to be a fake. So, I went back, watched the video again carefully, and finally found the real flag at 18:13.
